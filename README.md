# Breast Cancer Detection using SVC


## This repository presents a machine learning model for detecting breast cancer.
 * Model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
 * Data: Utilizes the well-known Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset from Kaggle.
 * Objective: To accurately classify benign and malignant tumors based on features extracted from the dataset.
## Key Steps:
 * Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values (if any).
   -  Performing simple EDA
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   
 * Model Training:
   - Train an SVC model on the training data.
   
 * Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the model's classification accuracy.
